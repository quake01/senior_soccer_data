In this README file, I will highlight important things about the data. The data consists of 17 CSV files for the 17 games played during the Denison Women's Soccer team 2022 season. 

The columns of importance were the Intensity and Volume metrics. For Volume: Distance, Sprint Distance, Power Plays, energy, and Impacts. For intensity, the metrics were Top Speed, Distance per minute, Power Score, Player Load, and Work Raito.

Code: Python version 3.8.3 was used to run the code.

Techniques used: K-Means and Elbow Methods.

All imports are included in the first cell of each Jupyter Notebook.
